# Loan Risk Analysis Project

## Project Background
As part of this challenge, my focus was on utilizing and refining the data analysis and machine learning skills developed during the course. The primary goals included:

- Employing logistic regression to evaluate loan risk.
- Managing data with Pandas to prepare for machine learning.
- Using training and testing datasets to validate the model.
- Reporting findings through structured documentation.

The project was structured around two key deliverables:

1. **Data Preparation**: Managing the data to create a conducive environment for model training.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Developing and assessing a logistic regression model aimed at predicting loan defaults.

## What I've Completed

### Deliverable 1: Data Preparation
- **Data Loading**: Utilized Pandas to load and inspect the lending data from `lending_data.csv`.
- **Feature Selection and Label Creation**: Extracted the `loan_status` as labels and used the remaining data as features.

### Deliverable 2: Model Training and Evaluation
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Trained the model using the training subset.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Generated a confusion matrix to evaluate model accuracy.
  - Produced a classification report to examine precision and recall metrics.
  - Addressed the model's effectiveness in predicting healthy and high-risk loans.

## Key Learnings
- **Logistic Regression**: Enhanced understanding of how logistic regression can be applied to binary classification problems in finance.
- **Data Handling**: Gained further experience in data manipulation and preparation for analytical purposes using Pandas.
- **Model Evaluation**: Learned to interpret the outcomes of predictive models through confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Tools and Resources Used
- **GitHub**: For repository management and version control.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing logistic regression and generating training/testing splits and evaluations.
